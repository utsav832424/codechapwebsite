                <p>Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne
                    Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and
                    flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.</p>

                    implement a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but with greater
                    uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. The first public implementation was Java 1.0 in 1995.</p>
                <p>Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed
                    among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small application module or

                <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in
                    the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception
                    handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December
                    1989.

                <p>Guido van Rossum is one of the world's most influential programmers. Van Rossum is the author of the
                    general-purpose programming language Python, which he started working on in 1989, and is now among
                    the most popular languages in use.</p>

                <p>Visual Basic 1.0 was introduced in 1991. The drag and drop design for creating the user interface is
                    derived from a prototype form generator developed by Alan Cooper and his company called Tripod. ...
                    Microsoft decided to combine Ruby with the Basic language to create Visual Basic.</p>
                <p>Visual Basic is a programming language and development environment created by Microsoft. The Visual
                    Basic program also includes features like "IntelliSense" and "Code Snippets," which automatically
                    generate code for visual objects added by the programmer.</p>

                <p>There are two native programming languages for iOS—Objective-C and Swift. This becomes
                    abundantly
                    clear as soon as you start your first project in Xcode. After pressing to create a new
                    application, you are taken to a page where you need to name your new project. You also have
                    to
                    pick a language, either Objective-C or Swift, to start you project.</p>
                <p>Next off, the language is designed to be safer than Objective-C. This is due to Swift’s
                    strong
                    typing system and error handling. The use of optionals, and the techniques that go with
                    them,
                    help prevent errors of null pointers and prevent pyramid of doom situations. Of course,
                    incorrect use of forced unwrapping can lead to issues in Swift, but it is designed to be
                    safer
                    if coded properly.</p>
