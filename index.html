                <p>There are two native programming languages for iOS—Objective-C and Swift. This becomes
                    abundantly
                    clear as soon as you start your first project in Xcode. After pressing to create a new
                    application, you are taken to a page where you need to name your new project. You also have
                    to
                    pick a language, either Objective-C or Swift, to start you project.</p>
                <p>Next off, the language is designed to be safer than Objective-C. This is due to Swift’s
                    strong
                    typing system and error handling. The use of optionals, and the techniques that go with
                    them,
                    help prevent errors of null pointers and prevent pyramid of doom situations. Of course,
                    incorrect use of forced unwrapping can lead to issues in Swift, but it is designed to be
                    safer
                    if coded properly.</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
                    programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any
                    machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>A further step towards the development of modern AI was the creation of The Logic Theorist.
                    Designed by Newell and Simon in 1955 it may be considered the first AI program. The person who
                    finally coined the term artificial intelligence and is regarded as the father of AI is John
                    McCarthy.</p>

                <p class="p_slider_title">React Native</p>
                <p>React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications
                    for iOS and Android. React Native also exposes JavaScript interfaces for platform APIs, so your
                    React Native apps can access platform features like the phone camera, or the user’s location.
                </p>
                <p>The Bottom Line. A native iOS and Android solution is still the best choice for projects in which
                    user experience and performance have absolute priority. But if a budget is limited and a
                    reasonable UX and performance still needs to be achieved, then React Native is definitely worth
                    considering.</p>

                <p class="p_slider_title">Node Js</p>
                <p>Node. js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about thirteen years after the introduction
                    of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape’s LiveWire Pro Web. The initial
                    release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and
                    later sponsored by Joyent.</p>
                <p>Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded
                    nature. It’s used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with
                    real-time, push-based architectures in mind.</p>

                <p>AngularJS was originally developed in 2009 by Miško Hevery at Brat Tech LLC as the software
                    behind an online JSON storage service, that would have been priced by the megabyte, for
                    easy-to-make applications for the enterprise.</p>
                <p>Angular was created at Google to solve Google-scale problems. To Google, this means millions of
                    lines of code, thousands of engineers, widely varying project schedules, requirements, and
                    workflows. The platform is designed to enable you to build and manage shared code, and to divide
                    work among appropriate roles.</p>
